# CMS-Forum
 A forum made using Handlebars template engine. 

 Initially I ran into errors deploying to Heroku due, I believe, to simply forgetting to add JawsDB to the application. 
 Also ran into Sequelize connection errors due to querying for tables that simply didnt exist, so combed through and 
 fixed those. Still currently having issues inserting new posts so there is a lack of seed data on the homepage, 
 but sign up/log in functionality appears to work via the deployed app.
